hello, welcome to my website.

i'm still working on getting the rooms together...

recently, i've been thinking about sharing and how i default to keeping most things close to my chest. in rebuilding this site, i'm hoping to construct it so i might share a little more than i would normally.

this site is a simple file explorer for the things i want to share with others.

some things to do:
- make blog
- make image space (for less project specific things)
- make friend space
- finish studio space
- optimize photos, and add more 
- create some kind of naming scheme for photos...
- lazy load for photos
- what should go on this page?
